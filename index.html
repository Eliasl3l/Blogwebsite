      The story about the outcast
      
      He used to be a pretty normal guy, a little mor intelligent than the average maybe, alot into sports.
      He changed school, whhere alot of people smoked, which he wasn't used to, and the people there were less like him, especially the guys, they only cared about superficialities.
      He made an exchange year and came back. Everybody changed, even if it was just a little, and it was strange, because everybody thought they knew him and he thought so too.
      
      Nothing feels like home anymore. Its terrible.
      Nerither moms nor dads palce. It just feels like I don't belong here, in Zurich.
      Nevertheless I do have some connections and friends, but they have weakened.
      It could just be another stay with a hostfamily, where I could get kicked out.
      Maybe the exchange year was a mistake. It has changed me. 
      I never had anxiety before, nor trouble with school or socializing.
      Now I do.
